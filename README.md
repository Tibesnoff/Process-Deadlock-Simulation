# Process-Deadlock-Simulation
This is a student created simulation to process through deadlock. 
This is created by Tyler Besnoff and Lucas Lecler with help from 
Dr.Thomas Schmidt.

Source code is given along with hopefully an autograder at some point.
A student takes the given function headings and codes the functions 
so that main runs correctly without deadlock.
